# greenspace

This project has two main goals:
- Develop a data set that approximates the greenspace density of census block groups within Springfield, MO city limits.
- Cross reference this greenspace data with demographic data, with the idea that this combined information will help highlight areas of the city where we might improve quality of life by developing accessible, beautiful, green spaces.
